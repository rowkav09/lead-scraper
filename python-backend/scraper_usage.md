## Usage

Run the script with your desired search term and number of results:

```bash
python main.py -s "Turkish Restaurants in Toronto Canada" -t 20
```

- `-s` or `--search`: Search query for Google Maps (default: "turkish stores in toronto Canada")
- `-t` or `--total`: Number of results to scrape (default: 1)
- `-o` or `--output`: Output CSV file path (default: result.csv)
- `--append`: Append results to the output file instead of overwriting (default: off)

## Example

Append new results to an existing CSV file:
```bash
python main.py -s "Turkish Restaurants in Toronto Canada" -t 20 -o toronto_turkish_restaurants.csv --append
```

The script will launch a browser, perform the search, and start scraping information. Progress will be displayed in the terminal, and results will be saved to the specified CSV file. If `--append` is used, new results will be added to the end of the file without removing previous data.

## Notes
- The script opens a visible browser window (not headless) for scraping.
- Google Maps DOM may change, which can break the script. If you encounter issues, update the XPaths in `main.py`.
- Avoid running too many scrapes in a short period to prevent being blocked by Google.
